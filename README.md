# usque

🥚➡️🍏🍎

Usque is an open-source reimplementation of the Cloudflare WARP client's MASQUE mode. It leverages the [Connect-IP (RFC 9484)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9484/) protocol and comes with many operation modes including a native tunnel (currently Linux only), a SOCKS5 proxy, and a HTTP proxy.

> **Personal fork note:** I'm using this primarily for learning how MASQUE/Connect-IP works. My main use case is the SOCKS5 proxy mode on Linux amd64.

## Installation

You can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Diniboy1123/usque/releases). For now, Android (`arm64`), Linux (`armv5`, `armv6`, `armv7`, `arm64`, `amd64`), Windows (`arm64`, `amd64`) and Darwin (`arm64`, `amd64`) binaries are provided. **However only the Linux `amd64` binary was tested.** If you have a different platform, you can build from source.

Extract the archive and you will find a binary named `usque` in the root directory. You can move this binary to a directory in your `PATH` to make it accessible from anywhere.

## Building from source

Since the tool is written in Go, it should be rather trivial.

1. Ensure that you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/). At least Go 1.25.5 is r
